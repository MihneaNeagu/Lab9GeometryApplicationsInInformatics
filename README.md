Consider the cubic B-spline with the knot vector=0.5,0.8,1.4,2.1,2.4,2.9,4.0,4.5,4.9 and the control points d1(−2,−3),d2(−1,2), d3(2,2),d4(3,0),d5(1,−3).


a) Determine the vector of nodes and the control points of the derivative of the curve.


b) Also use de Boor's algorithm for the derivative for to calculate (2.8).


c) Write a program in Python to represent, on the same graph, the given cubic B-spline and its derivative. You can also use the omdl library, see the model.py file for an example.
